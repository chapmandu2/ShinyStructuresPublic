This project is a toy example of a shiny app that depicts compound structures (from MOL files) using the ChemDoodle web framework.  

A nice implentation of this would be as a shiny widget that is an extension of DT for datatables.  This would allow R users to easily visualise tables of data that contain chemical information including the compound structure.  What isn't clear is how to implement a widget within a widget - ie a ChemDoodle widget within a datatable widget?
